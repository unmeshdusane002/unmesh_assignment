						We end up with some helpful information that will assist you in building better websites. We look at some new tags that will be introduced in HTML5 to help describe the structure of your pages. HTML5 is the latest version of HTML (still under development at the time of writing). Before learning about these elements, you need a good grasp of how CSS is used to control the design of web pages.There is a chapter that talks you through a design process that you might like to follow when creating a new website.Finally, we end up looking at topics that will help you onceyou have built your site, such as putting it on the web, search engine optimisation (SEO) and using analytics software to track who comes to your site and what they are looking at.

						When you ask your browser for a web page, the request is sent across the Internet to a special computer known as a web server which hosts the website.Web servers are special computers that are constantly connected to the Internet, and are optimized to send web pages out to people who request them. Some big companies run their own web servers, but it is morecommon to use the services of a web hosting company who charge a fee to host your site.</p>

						We will spend the first chapter looking at how HTML is used to create web pages. You will see that you start by writing down thewords you want to appear on your page. You then add tags or elements to the words so that the browser knows what is a ading,   where a paragraph begins and ends, and so on.The rest of this section introduces the tags you have at your disposal to create web pages, into chapters on:text, lists, links, images, tables,forms, video audio and flash, and miscellaneous elements. I should warn you that the examples in the first nine chapters are not exciting to look at, yet they are the foundation of every web page. The following chapters on CSS will show you how to make your pages look a lot more interesting

						People access websites using software called a web browser.Popular examples include Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari,Chrome, and Opera.In order to view a web page,users might type a web address into their browser, follow a link from another site, or use a bookmark.Software manufacturers regularly release new versions of browsers with new features and supporting new additions to languages. It is important, however, to remember that many computer owners will not be running the latest versions of these browsers. Therefore you cannot rely on all visitors to your site being able to use the latest functionality offered in allbrowsers.
